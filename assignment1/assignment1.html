  404 Page Not Found by Kate Wagner is about the extinction of the original internet, which was made before we were forcibly organized and pushed into social media, the internet that was stolen from us. I find it interesting how comfortable we are with what was taken, especially because we still feel the individualistic calling the old internet gave its users. People curate their social media, making everything on theme, even linking songs to posts so that everything works together, it's almost to an extreme, like people are trying to fill the void the origins of social media left. 
  </p>
 
  <p>
  I think I'm contributing to the decay in addition to what Kate Wagner talks about. I'm studying UX/UI, and nowadays that feels job like the sanitization of the internet. My semester project in one of my classes is to redesign a clunky website or app, a remnant of older internet, and to turn it clean, better, perfect version of itself. "The scene of this struggle between the hideous-beautiful old internet and the cleanly if ungodly 2.0 variety played out in the mid-2000s:" These sites aren't old enough to be "vintage" websites, but are old enough to be outdated and slow. "... Apple or Google, the two major smartphone operating system providers&ndash;gives us little room for variety or originality; even the apps and platforms themselves have lost their early skeuomorphic charm." The job of designers nowadays is to normalize everything, instead of making the bold moves that past internet users did. 
  </p>

 <p>
 How do we fix this? The solution to me is to give the control back to the users. The designers need to let the reigns of perfection go a bit. Let the people have more control over what they can edit and modify, letting them mess up the perfection the designers make. Maybe even giving them the tools to do so. 
 </p>

 <p>
 Companies nowadays are so concerned with keeping the users on the site, making them multifunctional to the point of absurdity. You can shop, watch TV, and basically google on all social media. The users deserve to have some control over the experiences that control their day-to-day, even if it's just the ability to make your Instagram background blue with a couple of funny silly gifs in your bio. 
 </p>

 <p>
 I don't think this is the type of analysis you were hoping for when it came to this article, but it did really make me reflect (and give me some minor guilt over my career choice). I sadly enjoy the newer look the internet has today, I enjoy how simple it is to find things. However, I think there is a middle ground, where the backgrounds aren't neon and the text is a reasonable size, where we can return to an older idea of creating community. "It's about time for a little revenge from the old internet." Is a good way to sum it up. I don't think we can return to the communist ideas Wagner wants, the internet is too far gone to have that, Amazon alone owns 30-40% of the internet. 
 </p>

 <p>
 We need to level the playing field. Something closer to Internet socialism instead of communism, where people get what they need and don't need to sacrifice anything for what should be our right on the Internet. I don't know how we would do that though, not because it's impossible, but because this isn't something I know enough about. Kate Wagner and people like her are the ones who will find solutions to this out-of-control problem. Web 3.0 is supposedly right around the corner, and when that comes that's when the change needs to happen.
