As a sophomore at Columbia College of Chicago, I am pursuing a bachelor's in UX and UI, with a minor in Game Art. My educational journey has equipped me with a diverse skill set tailored to the demands of the industry. Proficient in Blender, Figma, and Photoshop at an intermediate level, I leverage these tools to create compelling visual assets. Additionally, I possess a solid foundation in Maya and Concept Art, enhancing my capabilities in 3D modeling and design. This blend of technical proficiency and artistic insight positions me as a promising candidate ready to contribute to innovative projects in game development and interactive design.
